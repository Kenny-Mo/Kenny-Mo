- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kenny-Mo. I'm a social entrepreneur with a sparkly personality and a charged mind in rural North West in South Africa.
- 👀 I’m interested in Social Innovation and its role in the Sustainable Development of Marginalized Community. I want to explore the possibilities Opensource could play in the development of Rural Capital(Human/Social/Intitutional)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science (via IBM's Cognitive Class) to upskill myself in Data Driven Decision Making. Am also a Global MBA candidate.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on "How To" learning projects for the technologically marginalised. I'm REALLY struggling to navigate around coding/programming DIY tutorials, and I'm the local Anita Borg.
